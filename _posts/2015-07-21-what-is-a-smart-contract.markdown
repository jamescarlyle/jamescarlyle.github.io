title:  "What is a Smart Contract"
---

I'm spending quite a lot of time experimenting with [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) platform. I am using the term "Smart Contracts" below in the sense that they exist on Ethereum, and have tried to capture what makes them special for me:

# Features
1. Smart contracts are executable business logic and data, written in a computer language
2. Smart contracts can run on a public block-chain / distributed ledger that is de-centralised
3. The block chain is secure
 

# Taking each of these in turn:
## Contracts are executable business logic and data, written in a computer language
1. they are not ambiguous
  1. they do not need a judicial system or lawyers to interpret them
2. they can be unit-tested
3. they execute quickly in seconds, automating back-office operations that are often manual today
4. they are binding
  1. participants send irrevocable transactions and value into them
5. BUT the State may still consider them to be illegal, or at least entered into illegally
  1. will we need a State-sponsored block-chain that allows the State to retain control?
  2. or will a legal precedent be set that if the contract is executed and participated in an environment where the state has no control, that the State cannot intervene?
## Contracts can run on a public block-chain / distributed ledger that is decentralised
1. Contracts running on it are beyond the reach of manipulation
  1. they are executed on thousands of computers, beyond the control of a single powerful entity
2. Contracts on a public block-chain are permanent
  1. they cannot be re-written (they can be cancelled or reconfigured, but only through functions that are permanent and visible from the point of creation and before any participation)
  2. they can be very long-lived, and retain history and data state
3. Contracts do not rely on trust between parties
  1. they can disintermediate “middle-men” such as escrow agents and banks
  2. but where there is an interface with the real-world (e.g. exchange of goods), creative thinking is needed to prove real-world events
## The block chain is secure
1. All transactions are controlled by public/private keys and open hash cryptography algorithms – at least as secure as BitCoin
