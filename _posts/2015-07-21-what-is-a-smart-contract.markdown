title:  "What is a Smart Contract"
---

I'm spending quite a lot of time experimenting with [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) on the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) platform. I am using the term "Smart Contracts" below in the sense that they exist on Ethereum, and have tried to capture what makes them special for me:

# Features
1. Smart contracts are executable business logic and data, written in a computer language
2. Smart contracts can run on a public block-chain / distributed ledger that is de-centralised
3. The block chain is secure.
 
Taking each of these in turn:

# Contracts are executable business logic and data, written in a computer language

* they are not ambiguous
  * they do not need a judicial system or lawyers to interpret them
* they can be unit-tested
* they execute quickly in seconds, automating back-office operations that are often manual today
* they are binding
  * participants send irrevocable transactions and value into them
* BUT the State may still consider them to be illegal, or at least entered into illegally
  * will we need a State-sponsored block-chain that allows the State to retain control?
  * or will a legal precedent be set that if the contract is executed and participated in an environment where the state has no control, that the State cannot intervene?

# Contracts can run on a public block-chain / distributed ledger that is decentralised

* Contracts running on it are beyond the reach of manipulation
  * they are executed on thousands of computers, beyond the control of a single powerful entity
* Contracts on a public block-chain are permanent
  * they cannot be re-written (they can be cancelled or reconfigured, but only through functions that are permanent and visible from the point of creation and before any participation)
  * they can be very long-lived, and retain history and data state
* Contracts do not rely on trust between parties
  * they can disintermediate “middle-men” such as escrow agents and banks
  * but where there is an interface with the real-world (e.g. exchange of goods), creative thinking is needed to prove real-world events

# The block chain is secure

* All transactions are controlled by public/private keys and open hash cryptography algorithms – at least as secure as BitCoin
